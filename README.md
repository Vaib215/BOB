# BOB
BOB stands for Blackboard Organiser Bot. This is a python-based bot which uses selenium for web automation. I use this bot to start my classes on Blackboard.
Recently, I was struggling again & again to check my timetable and then login into blackboard to start the class. So I came up with the idea of BOB.

I hope you liked it. 

Note: This bot just starts the class. Nothing else.
